This directory contains autotests based on Qt Test. In order to run the autotests
reliably, you need to configure a desktop to match the test environment that these
tests are written for.

The tests need network connection and access to an Enginio backend.
To be able to run the tests the following environment variables have to be set:

ENGINIO_EMAIL_ADDRESS
ENGINIO_LOGIN_PASSWORD
ENGINIO_API_URL
